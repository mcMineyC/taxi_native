# Taxi
This is where you download Taxi!
Refer to the table for which file to download.  Make sure to read the install instructions below, as some operating systems have quirks.

# Install Instructions
## Android
Simply download the APK and open it.  If you've sideloaded before, you won't need to take any additional steps.  Otherwise, follow the dialog prompts to allow sideloading.  If you have trouble, do a quick Google search.
A note on updating Taxi: If you've installed Taxi previously, you will need to uninstall the old version first.  I've tried to fix this but so far have been unsuccessful.

## Linux
Unfortunately, I don't currently have the time to develop dedicated packages for each distro, so you are left with a plain archive for now.  I assume you know the drill.

## Mac
As a side effect of Apple, apps distributed without codesigning require an extra step to run.  Simply download and double click the archive ot extract.  Right click on the Taxi app in the newly extracted folder and select "Open" and then "Open" in the warning that pops up.  Now make sure Taxi is closed and move the new app to your Applications folder, selecting replace when and if prompted.

## Windows
Simply download the installer and double click to install.  Ironically this is the least complicated install.
