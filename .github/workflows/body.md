# Install Instructions
## Android
Simply download the APK and open it.  If you've sideloaded before, you won't need to take any additional steps.  Otherwise, follow the dialog prompts to allow sideloading.  If you have trouble, do a quick Google search.
A note on updating Taxi: If you've installed Taxi previously, you will need to uninstall the old version first.  I've tried to fix this but so far have been unsuccessful.

## Linux
Unfortunately, I don't currently have the time to develop dedicated packages for each distro, so you are left with a plain archive for now.  I assume you know the drill.

## Mac
