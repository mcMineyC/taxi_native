Bugs
- scrollability (artist)
- search doesn't work for anything but songs
  - check ts_mod.js

TODO before announcing:
- finish playlist support
  - make dialog that edits the songs
  - implement deletion logic
  - possibly do rearrangement
  - send the stuff to the backend (new topic, don't coerce into old HLV type)
  - handle the stuff on the backend
    - maybe modularize playlist creation function or at least copy it
    - need to "add" songs before playlist is created since playlist stores the ids
    - easy fix: hash the song ids using a map() call
